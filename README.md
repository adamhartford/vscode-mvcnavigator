- Example: `@Html.Partial("~/Views/Shared/_Navigation.cshtml")` ‚Üí jumps to partial view

### üè∑Ô∏è Tag Helper & HTML Helper Support
Navigate with ASP.NET Core tag helpers and classic HTML helpers.

### üè¢ Advanced Features

- Areas & multi-project: seamless navigation across Areas and multi-project workspaces
- Fallback search: finds controllers and view components in shared or non-standard files

2. Locate the target file (controller, view, or action)
3. Navigate directly to the destination
4. Position the cursor at the exact method or view
